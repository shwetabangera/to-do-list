To-do lists don't need to be complicated—plenty of people use a pen and paper for the job without any problem. And yet a new to-do list app seems to come out every day. Why? Because keeping track of your tasks is an intensely personal thing, and people will reject anything that doesn't feel right pretty much instantly. That makes it hard to find the right ones.
Todoist helps for balancing power and simplicity.
Make it fast to add and organize tasks- Ideally, a task is added and categorized in a couple taps or keystrokes.

Offer multiple ways to organize your tasks- Tags, lists, projects, and due dates are all helpful, and the best apps offer at least a few categories like this.

Remind you about self-imposed deadlines- Notifications, widgets, emails—the best applications make it obvious when something needs to be completed.

Offer clean user interfaces-Well-designed to-do apps fit into your workflow so you can get back to what you're supposed to be doing.
